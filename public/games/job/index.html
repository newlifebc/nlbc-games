        <ul>
            <li>The oldest person is 'God'</li>
            <li>Everyone closes their eyes except for 'God'. 'God' taps someone once to be Job. 'God' taps someone twice to be Satan.</li>
            <li>Everyone closes their eyes and 'God' says "Satan choose to destroy one of Job's possessions"</li>
            <li>Satan wakes up and chooses someone to destroy.</li>
            <li>Satan goes back to sleep</li>
            <li>Everyone wakes up</li>
            <li>'God' announces who has been destroyed</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Why did Satan have to ask God for permission to test Job?
                Satan needs an audience. Satan wanted to prove to God that even Job would foresake God if his stuff were taken away.
            </li>
            <li>Why did God allow Satan to kill Job's family?
                What if the rest of Job's family were good people too?
            </li>
